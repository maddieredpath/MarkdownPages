**One of my favorite parts of college has been being involved in Fight Night Mizzou**

#### Here is a rundown for you.

- I fought my freshman year
    - I won :)
- I was on the staff my sophomore year
- I was the director my junio year
- I am the director again my senior year!

#### What is Fight Night? 

Fight Night is a non-profit that raises money and awareness for Pediatric Cancer Research. We choose 20 fighters, 10 guys and 10 girls,
to face eachother in a boxing match after 8 weeks of training. Last year, we raised **$29,000!** This year, I believe we will blow this amount
out of the water. Our goal is **$40,000!**
